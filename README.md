# Snake Game — Python Turtle Edition
A fun and enhanced version of the classic Snake game built using Python's Turtle graphics library.
This version includes a visual countdown timer, regular and special food, score tracking, and clean object-oriented structure.


# Features:
1. Classic snake movement using arrow keys
2. Regular food that increases the snake length and score
3. Special food that appears randomly and disappears if not eaten within 10 seconds
4. Visual timer bar that shows time left for the special food
5. Collision detection with walls and snake tail
6. Clean OOP design with Snake, Food, SpecialFood, and Scoreboard classes


# How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-timer-game.git
cd snake-timer-game

2. Run the game:
python main.py


# Technologies Used:
1. Python 3
2. Turtle Graphics (standard Python library, no installation needed)
3. Object-Oriented Programming
4. ontimer() event system for countdowns


# Gameplay Controls:

⬆️ Up Arrow – Move up
⬇️ Down Arrow – Move down
⬅️ Left Arrow – Move left
➡️ Right Arrow – Move right


#What I Learned:
1. Managing real-time game loops in Python
2. Using classes to separate responsibilities
3. Drawing UI elements with Turtle (e.g., countdown bar)
4. Handling user input and custom timing mechanics


# Future Improvements
1. Add a pause/restart button
2. Add difficulty levels or increasing speed
3. Store high scores
4. Use a custom theme and graphics (PNG-based)
